	abstract = {We present {LaMDA}: Language Models for Dialog Applications. {LaMDA} is a family of Transformerbased neural language models specialized for dialog, which have up to 137B parameters and are pre-trained on 1.56T words of public dialog data and web text. While model scaling alone can improve quality, it shows less improvements on safety and factual grounding. We demonstrate that ﬁne-tuning with annotated data and enabling the model to consult external knowledge sources can lead to signiﬁcant improvements towards the two key challenges of safety and factual grounding. The ﬁrst challenge, safety, involves ensuring that the model’s responses are consistent with a set of human values, such as preventing harmful suggestions and unfair bias. We quantify safety using a metric based on an illustrative set of human values, and we ﬁnd that ﬁltering candidate responses using a {LaMDA} classiﬁer ﬁne-tuned with a small amount of crowdworker-annotated data offers a promising approach to improving model safety. The second challenge, factual grounding, involves enabling the model to consult external knowledge sources, such as an information retrieval system, a language translator, and a calculator. We quantify factuality using a groundedness metric, and we ﬁnd that our approach enables the model to generate responses grounded in known sources, rather than responses that merely sound plausible. Finally, we explore the use of {LaMDA} in the domains of education and content recommendations, and analyze their helpfulness and role consistency.},

	abstract = {We present {DeepSeek}-V3, a strong Mixture-of-Experts ({MoE}) language model with 671B total parameters with 37B activated for each token. To achieve efficient inference and cost-effective training, {DeepSeek}-V3 adopts Multi-head Latent Attention ({MLA}) and {DeepSeekMoE} architectures, which were thoroughly validated in {DeepSeek}-V2. Furthermore, {DeepSeek}-V3 pioneers an auxiliary-loss-free strategy for load balancing and sets a multi-token prediction training objective for stronger performance. We pre-train {DeepSeek}-V3 on 14.8 trillion diverse and high-quality tokens, followed by Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning stages to fully harness its capabilities. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that {DeepSeek}-V3 outperforms other open-source models and achieves performance comparable to leading closed-source models. Despite its excellent performance, {DeepSeek}-V3 requires only 2.788M H800 {GPU} hours for its full training. In addition, its training process is remarkably stable. Throughout the entire training process, we did not experience any irrecoverable loss spikes or perform any rollbacks. The model checkpoints are available at https://github.com/deepseek-ai/{DeepSeek}-V3.},

Through {RL}, {DeepSeek}-R1-Zero naturally emerges with numerous powerful and intriguing reasoning behaviors. However, it encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce {DeepSeek}-R1, which incorporates multi-stage training and cold-start data before {RL}. {DeepSeekR}1 achieves performance comparable to {OpenAI}-o1-1217 on reasoning tasks. To support the research community, we open-source {DeepSeek}-R1-Zero, {DeepSeek}-R1, and six dense models (1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, 70B) distilled from {DeepSeek}-R1 based on Qwen and Llama.},

Tanenbaum takes a structured approach to explaining how networks work from the inside out. He starts with an explanation of the physical layer of networking, computer hardware and transmission systems; then works his way up to network applications. Tanenbaum's in-depth application coverage includes email; the domain name system; the World Wide Web (both client- and server-side); and multimedia (including voice over {IP}, Internet radio video on demand, video conferencing, and streaming media. Each chapter follows a consistent approach. Tanenbaum presents key principles, then illustrates them utilising real-world example networks that run through the entire book—the Internet, and wireless networks, including Wireless {LANs}, broadband wireless and Bluetooth. The Fifth Edition includes a chapter devoted exclusively to network security.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2410.21276},
	abstract = {{GPT}-4o is an autoregressive omni model that accepts as input any combination of text, audio, image, and video, and generates any combination of text, audio, and image outputs. It's trained end-to-end across text, vision, and audio, meaning all inputs and outputs are processed by the same neural network. {GPT}-4o can respond to audio inputs in as little as 232 milliseconds, with an average of 320 milliseconds, which is similar to human response time in conversation. It matches {GPT}-4 Turbo performance on text in English and code, with significant improvement on text in non-English languages, while also being much faster and 50{\textbackslash}\% cheaper in the {API}. {GPT}-4o is especially better at vision and audio understanding compared to existing models. In line with our commitment to building {AI} safely and consistent with our voluntary commitments to the White House, we are sharing the {GPT}-4o System Card, which includes our Preparedness Framework evaluations. In this System Card, we provide a detailed look at {GPT}-4o's capabilities, limitations, and safety evaluations across multiple categories, focusing on speech-to-speech while also evaluating text and image capabilities, and measures we've implemented to ensure the model is safe and aligned. We also include third-party assessments on dangerous capabilities, as well as discussion of potential societal impacts of {GPT}-4o's text and vision capabilities.},

	abstract = {The o1 model series is trained with large-scale reinforcement learning to reason using chain of thought. These advanced reasoning capabilities provide new avenues for improving the safety and robustness of our models. In particular, our models can reason about our safety policies in context when responding to potentially unsafe prompts, through deliberative alignment. This leads to state-of-the-art performance on certain benchmarks for risks such as generating illicit advice, choosing stereotyped responses, and succumbing to known jailbreaks. Training models to incorporate a chain of thought before answering has the potential to unlock substantial benefits, while also increasing potential risks that stem from heightened intelligence. Our results underscore the need for building robust alignment methods, extensively stress-testing their efficacy, and maintaining meticulous risk management protocols. This report outlines the safety work carried out for the {OpenAI} o1 and {OpenAI} o1-mini models, including safety evaluations, external red teaming, and Preparedness Framework evaluations.},

	abstract = {This report introduces a new family of multimodal models, Gemini, that exhibit remarkable capabilities across image, audio, video, and text understanding. The Gemini family consists of Ultra, Pro, and Nano sizes, suitable for applications ranging from complex reasoning tasks to on-device memory-constrained use-cases. Evaluation on a broad range of benchmarks shows that our most-capable Gemini Ultra model advances the state of the art in 30 of 32 of these benchmarks - notably being the first model to achieve human-expert performance on the well-studied exam benchmark {MMLU}, and improving the state of the art in every one of the 20 multimodal benchmarks we examined. We believe that the new capabilities of the Gemini family in cross-modal reasoning and language understanding will enable a wide variety of use cases. We discuss our approach toward post-training and deploying Gemini models responsibly to users through services including Gemini, Gemini Advanced, Google {AI} Studio, and Cloud Vertex {AI}.},

	abstract = {In this report, we introduce the Gemini 1.5 family of models, representing the next generation of highly compute-efficient multimodal models capable of recalling and reasoning over fine-grained information from millions of tokens of context, including multiple long documents and hours of video and audio. The family includes two new models: (1) an updated Gemini 1.5 Pro, which exceeds the February version on the great majority of capabilities and benchmarks; (2) Gemini 1.5 Flash, a more lightweight variant designed for efficiency with minimal regression in quality. Gemini 1.5 models achieve near-perfect recall on long-context retrieval tasks across modalities, improve the state-of-the-art in long-document {QA}, long-video {QA} and long-context {ASR}, and match or surpass Gemini 1.0 Ultra's state-of-the-art performance across a broad set of benchmarks. Studying the limits of Gemini 1.5's long-context ability, we find continued improvement in next-token prediction and near-perfect retrieval ({\textgreater}99\%) up to at least 10M tokens, a generational leap over existing models such as Claude 3.0 (200k) and {GPT}-4 Turbo (128k). Finally, we highlight real-world use cases, such as Gemini 1.5 collaborating with professionals on completing their tasks achieving 26 to 75\% time savings across 10 different job categories, as well as surprising new capabilities of large language models at the frontier; when given a grammar manual for Kalamang, a language with fewer than 200 speakers worldwide, the model learns to translate English to Kalamang at a similar level to a person who learned from the same content.},

It is widely recognized that continuously scaling both data size and model size can lead to significant improvements in model intelligence. However, the research and industry community has limited experience in effectively scaling extremely large models, whether they are dense or Mixture-of-Expert ({MoE}) models. Many critical details regarding this scaling process were only disclosed with the recent release of {DeepSeek} V3. Concurrently, we are developing Qwen2.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2308.07702},
	abstract = {Modern large language models ({LLMs}) exhibit a remarkable capacity for role-playing, enabling them to embody not only human characters but also non-human entities. This versatility allows them to simulate complex human-like interactions and behaviors within various contexts, as well as to emulate specific objects or systems. While these capabilities have enhanced user engagement and introduced novel modes of interaction, the influence of role-playing on {LLMs}' reasoning abilities remains underexplored. In this study, we introduce a strategically designed role-play prompting methodology and assess its performance under the zero-shot setting across twelve diverse reasoning benchmarks. Our empirical results illustrate that role-play prompting consistently surpasses the standard zero-shot approach across most datasets. Notably, in experiments conducted using {ChatGPT}, accuracy on {AQuA} rises from 53.5\% to 63.8\%, and on Last Letter from 23.8\% to 84.2\%.Upon further comparison with the Zero-Shot-{CoT} technique, which prompts the model to "think step by step", our study demonstrates that role-play prompting acts as a more effective trigger for the {CoT} process. This highlights its potential to augment the reasoning capabilities of {LLMs}. We release our code at https://github.com/{NKU}-{HLT}/Role-Play-Prompting.},

	abstract = {{BERT} (Devlin et al., 2018) and {RoBERTa} (Liu et al., 2019) has set a new state-of-the-art performance on sentence-pair regression tasks like semantic textual similarity ({STS}). However, it requires that both sentences are fed into the network, which causes a massive computational overhead: Finding the most similar pair in a collection of 10,000 sentences requires about 50 million inference computations ({\textasciitilde}65 hours) with {BERT}. The construction of {BERT} makes it unsuitable for semantic similarity search as well as for unsupervised tasks like clustering. In this publication, we present Sentence-{BERT} ({SBERT}), a modification of the pretrained {BERT} network that use siamese and triplet network structures to derive semantically meaningful sentence embeddings that can be compared using cosine-similarity. This reduces the effort for finding the most similar pair from 65 hours with {BERT} / {RoBERTa} to about 5 seconds with {SBERT}, while maintaining the accuracy from {BERT}. We evaluate {SBERT} and {SRoBERTa} on common {STS} tasks and transfer learning tasks, where it outperforms other state-of-the-art sentence embeddings methods.},
