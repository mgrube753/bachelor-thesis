## Prompt

Provide a comprehensive overview of research papers from 2021-2024 covering the most significant advancements in Large Language Model (LLM) architectures, training methods, and applications. Focus on high-impact papers, survey articles, and research that has significantly influenced the field.

## Summary of top 4

Recent research provides comprehensive overviews of Large Language Models (LLMs), highlighting their transformative impact on Natural Language Processing (NLP). These studies explore LLM architectures, focusing on transformer-based models like GPT and BERT (Ren, 2024; Xue, 2024). They discuss advanced training techniques, including self-supervised and transfer learning (Xue, 2024). LLMs demonstrate versatility across various NLP tasks such as text generation, sentiment analysis, and question answering (Ren, 2024; Xue, 2024). Researchers also address optimization strategies, including model compression and explainability (Ren, 2024). The papers emphasize LLMs' applications in diverse fields like healthcare, education, and agriculture (Khan Raiaan et al., 2024). However, they also highlight challenges such as computational requirements, sample inefficiency, and ethical considerations (Ren, 2024; Naveed et al., 2023). Future research directions include developing efficient architectures, few-shot learning, and privacy-preserving techniques (Ren, 2024; Naveed et al., 2023).
