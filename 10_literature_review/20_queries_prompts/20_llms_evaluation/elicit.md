What are the best metrics for evaluating the quality and pedagogical value of questions generated by Large Language Models?

## Summary of top 4

Recent studies have explored the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating high-quality educational questions. Researchers have developed benchmarks and evaluation metrics to assess LLMs' questioning capabilities in various domains (Chen et al., 2024; Deroy et al., 2024). These metrics include relevance, coverage, representativeness, consistency, appropriateness, novelty, complexity, and grammaticality. Studies have shown that LLMs like GPT-4 and Claude2 demonstrate significant potential in generating questions across different subjects and cognitive levels (Chen et al., 2024; Scaria et al., 2024). The MIRROR approach, which uses multiple LLMs for iterative review, has improved the correlation between automated and human evaluations (Deroy et al., 2024). Research indicates that LLM-generated questions can be of high quality and pedagogical relevance, with over 90% meeting expert criteria (Scaria et al., 2024). Furthermore, well-designed prompting strategies can lead to questions that are difficult for subject matter experts to distinguish from human-authored ones (Wang et al., 2022).
