\subsection{Key Findings}

% what have we achieved?

% strengths and weaknesses
% --> e.g. deepseek does not adhere to the format guidelines, a solution would be a format in json format. that was not used due to the semantic similarity aspect (would decrease the performance in this case)
% --> better content adherence check at manipulated source content: instead of focusing on many different materials, focus on a few materials, manipulate them a little bit instead of much, and then check the performance of the model on these materials. still this was the secondary goal of rq1, the common goal was the common content adherence check
