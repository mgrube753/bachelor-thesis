The Session Layer
The session layer allows users on different machines to establish sessions between them. Sessions offer various services, including dialog control (keeping
track of whose turn it is to transmit), token management (preventing two parties
from attempting the same critical operation simultaneously), and synchronization

(checkpointing long transmissions to allow them to pick up from where they left
off in the event of a crash and subsequent recovery).
