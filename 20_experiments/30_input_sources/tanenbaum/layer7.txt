The Application Layer
The application layer contains a variety of protocols that are commonly
needed by users. One widely used application protocol is HTTP (HyperText
Transfer Protocol), which is the basis for the World Wide Web. When a
browser wants a Web page, it sends the name of the page it wants to the server
hosting the page using HTTP. The server then sends the page back. Other application protocols are used for file transfer, electronic mail, and network news.
