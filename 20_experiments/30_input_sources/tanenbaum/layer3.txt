The Network Layer
The network layer controls the operation of the subnet. A key design issue is
determining how packets are routed from source to destination. Routes can be
based on static tables that are ''wired into'' the network and rarely changed, or
more often they can be updated automatically to avoid failed components. They
can also be determined at the start of each conversation, for example, a terminal
session, such as a login to a remote machine. Finally, they can be highly dynamic, being determined anew for each packet to reflect the current network load.
If too many packets are present in the subnet at the same time, they will get in
one another's way, forming bottlenecks. Handling congestion is also a responsibility of the network layer, in conjunction with higher layers that adapt the load

they place on the network. More generally, the quality of service provided (delay,
transit time, jitter, etc.) is also a network layer issue.
When a packet has to travel from one network to another to get to its destination, many problems can arise. The addressing used by the second network may
be different from that used by the first one. The second one may not accept the
packet at all because it is too large. The protocols may differ, and so on. It is up
to the network layer to overcome all these problems to allow heterogeneous networks to be interconnected.
In broadcast networks, the routing problem is simple, so the network layer is
often thin or even nonexistent.
