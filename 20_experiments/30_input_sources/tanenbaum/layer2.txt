The Data Link Layer
The main task of the data link layer is to transform a raw transmission facility into a line that appears free of undetected transmission errors. It does so by
masking the real errors so the network layer does not see them. It accomplishes
this task by having the sender break up the input data into data frames (typically
a few hundred or a few thousand bytes) and transmit the frames sequentially. If
the service is reliable, the receiver confirms correct receipt of each frame by sending back an acknowledgement frame.
Another issue that arises in the data link layer (and most of the higher layers
as well) is how to keep a fast transmitter from drowning a slow receiver in data.
Some traffic regulation mechanism may be needed to let the transmitter know
when the receiver can accept more data.
Broadcast networks have an additional issue in the data link layer: how to
control access to the shared channel. A special sublayer of the data link layer, the
medium access control sublayer, deals with this problem.
